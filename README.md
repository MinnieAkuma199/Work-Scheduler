## User Story

```md
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```
## What I Learned
 
I focused on incorporating other libraries to create the work day scheduler. These included:
-moment.js
-jQuery
-Bootstrap
Working with jQuery can have quite a few benefits as compared to vanilla JS such as being able to call the object keys a lot more simplicitly.
